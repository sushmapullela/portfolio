<p>George Weasley (b. 1 April, 1978) was a pure-blood wizard, son of Arthur Weasley and Molly Weasley (n√©e Prewett), brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Ron, Ginny, and twin brother of the late Fred Weasley. George's first few years were marked by the height of the First Wizarding War and when Lord Voldemort fall for the first time. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989 to 1996 with Fred, and was Sorted into Gryffindor house. He and Fred were popular students, becoming Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team in their second year, and members of Dumbledore's Army in their unfinished seventh year.

A born prankster and inventor, George left Hogwarts prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur, alongside his twin brother, and opened the joke shop Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at 93 Diagon Alley. He was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts; in the latter, Fred died, leaving George devastated.
